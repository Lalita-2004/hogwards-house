        Ravenclaw House is one of the four houses at Hogwart into which the students are Sorted when they start their first year. Ravenclaw is the Hogwarts house of founder Rowena Ravenclaw. The House places high value on intelligence, wit, and learning. During Harryâ€™s time at Hogwarts, the head of Ravenclaw House was Filius Flitwick.

    Blazon: azure, an eagle or (that is, a golden eagle on a blue field, hence the Ravenclaw colours of blue and bronze)
    <br>House  Helena Ravenclaw, the Grey Lady
    <br>Location:
    Ravenclaw Tower, which is located on the west side of the castle (OP18); the entrance is a door at the top of a tightly winding spiral staircase that leads up from the fifth floor.</p>
    <p>
        The door has neither handle nor keyhole, but a talking bronze knocker in the shape of an eagle. Rather than asking for a conventional password, the knocker will ask a question; if answered correctly, the knocker will compliment the person on the answer and the door will swing open (DH29).

The common room, like the other House common rooms, is decorated in House colours (blue and bronze silk wall hangings, in this case, and a midnight-blue carpet decorated with stars). The room is wide, circular, and very airy, with a domed ceiling painted with stars, and walls with graceful arched windows that provide a spectacular view of the surrounding mountains. There are bookcases, tables, and chairs, and opposite the entrance is another door leading to the dormitories. Beside this door is a plinth on which stands a life-size statue in white marble of Rowena Ravenclaw wearing her diadem (DH29).
