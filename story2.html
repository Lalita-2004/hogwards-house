        Slytherin House is one of the four houses into which students are Sorted when they start their first year at Hogwarts. Slytherin House was founded by Salazar Slytherin around 990AD. His personal belief in the superiority of Pure Blood wizards still influences the attitudes of Slytherin members today.

    Blazon: vert, a serpent argent (that is, a silver serpent on a green field, hence the Slytherin colours of green and silver) (PA15, GF15). The serpent device signifies the founderâ€™s gift of being a Parselmouth (CS11).
    <br>House Ghost: The Bloody Baron (PS7).
    <br>Location:
    The Slytherin common room is a low-ceilinged, dungeon-like room with greenish lamps and chairs, with skulls all around. It is located under the lake, and has tapestries decorated with scenes from the lives of famous Slytherins (DH23, Pm). According to the Slytherin House Introduction Letter, the beds in the dormitories are four-posters with green silk hangings and covers embroidered with silver threads. You can hear the soothing sound of the lake lapping against the windows at night (Pm)
