        Hufflepuff House is the Hogwarts house of founder Helga Hufflepuff. Hufflepuff House values character traits such as dedication, fair play, and hard work. Hufflepuffs are often unjustly characterized as unintelligent or as losers not good enough for any of the other houses.

    <p>The Hufflepuff Common Room is accessed through a pile of barrels that is in a recess a little past the still life painting that is the entrance to the kitchens (Pm); to reach it, you enter a door to the right of the main staircase in the Entrance Hall and down a staircase there (GF17).Although it is therefore at dungeon level, it is “as dissimilar as possible” from the Potions classroom. The common room is decorated in House colours, which in this case means that there are lots of yellow hangings; like Gryffindor Tower, it has a lot of comfortable armchairs. There are “little underground tunnels leading to the dormitories, all of which have perfectly round doors, like barrel tops” (BLC, JKR).One gains entry to the Hufflepuff common room by tapping out the rhythm to the name “Helga Hufflepuff” on a stack of barrels. Tapping incorrectly or on the wrong barrel will cause one of the barrels to spill vinegar all over the person trying to enter (Pm: Hufflepuff).
